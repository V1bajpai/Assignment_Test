    # Create Main.java class
    1. I created RecentlyPlayedStore class where I have created Constructor and I have initialized two variables i.e. capacity and store.
        1. Function addSong(String user, String song) : 
            1. Here first I applied condition- if song already exists in playlist then Move the song to the end (most recently played)
            2. Second condition- If size is equal to the capacity then Remove the least recently played song if the playlist is full.
            3. After then I'm adding song in playlist and linking to the user.

        2. Function getRecentlyPlayedSongs(String user) :
            1. Here I'm return list of songs based on the user.
